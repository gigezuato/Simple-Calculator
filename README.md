# 🧮 Simple Calculator

A simple web-based calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates basic calculator functionality, theme switching, and a modular approach to development with separate branches for content, design, and features.

## 🛠️ Branch Structure

This repository is structured into three main branches to organize the development process:

| Branch           | Purpose                                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `content`        | Holds textual content, README updates, and documentation |
| `design`         | Contains CSS and styling changes                          |
| `features`       | Contains JavaScript functionality and core logic         |

> Recommended workflow: work on `features` for new functionality, `design` for styling, and `content` for documentation or textual changes.
